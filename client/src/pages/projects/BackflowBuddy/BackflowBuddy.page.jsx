        <p>A labor of love.</p>
        This was my first personal project that I ever published. The idea for
        this app was the very reason I set out on this journey learning to code,
        back in 2021. Having a full time job (and two kids born along the way),
        meant digging deep every night and every weekend. <p></p>
        Having no idea where to start, I began working my way down the
        FreeCodeCamp curriculum. After completing most of the curriculum by May
        of 2022, I realized that this type of app could not be created using web
        tech, at least not at that time. I switched gears and dove head first
        into Unity and C#. My goal was to solo the entire project, from soup to
        nuts. I created each and every asset from scratch, except the water -
        see Zibra Liquids. It took me a little over 2 years to learn Unity, C#,
        Blender (3D modeling, topology, textures, shaders etc.) and push through
        all of the post build production hurdles to eventually self publish this
        application.
