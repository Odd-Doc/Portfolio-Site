      <p>
        I’m passionate about building things, whether it’s a physical project or
        a creative idea. I thrive on turning concepts into reality and finding
        innovative solutions to challenges. With a hands-on approach and a keen
        eye for detail, I enjoy exploring new techniques and materials to create
        something unique and functional.
